#  the following scripts show how to use r to upload summary.txt to the opencpu server as the input to render an html report
#  then download the report to local storage
#  This function could be done by any script languange, such as java, perl or bash
#  by doing this, metalab can have the report easily, without the need to setup the r enviroment, but easily get all the report, especially with
#  various data visualization in the report
#  these report are all html based and could be linked/iframed on the website.


# curl way to make any opencpu request is detailed here: https://www.opencpu.org/api.html

# debug ----


























# R has the “feature” of turning character strings automatically into factor variables.
# This is great, when doing actual statistical work. It is this magic that allows R to turn multinomial variables into
# dummy variables in regression models and produce nice cross tables. When working with APIs, however,
# this “feature” becomes a hinderance. Let’s just turn it off. Note: this call only affects the current session;
# when you restart R, all settings will be back to normal.
